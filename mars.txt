Cold and dry planet. Not really interesting.
It has a small atmosfere.
It has no moons.
There was water in the atmosfere, but not anymore.
Is there life in mars? It looks like some bacteries are there.
Something is different here.

Cold and dry, but everything is my favourite color
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman
But the Mummy will appreciate the lack of humidity
